### Project Description:

My challenge with this project is to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I'm using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM, in addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, I'm also using a JavaScript date library to format timestamps.

### User Story:

AS A social media startup
I WANT an API for my social network that uses a NoSQL database
SO THAT my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data
